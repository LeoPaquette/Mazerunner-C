/*
 * Main function:
 * Handles the overall game flow for Maze Runner.
 * - Prompts the player for their name and dynamically allocates memory for it.
 * - Runs a game loop that:
 *   - Randomly generates maze dimensions and allocates the maze.
 *   - Initializes the maze with walls and carves paths.
 *   - Finds random valid openings for the maze entrance (top) and exit (bottom).
 *   - Sets the start and exit points in the maze.
 *   - Starts the player movement gameplay until the maze is solved or player quits.
 *   - Tracks and updates the playerâ€™s best 3 scores.
 *   - Frees allocated maze memory after each game.
 *   - Asks the player if they want to play again.
 * - At the end, displays the player's top 3 best runs and thanks them.
 * - Frees dynamically allocated player name memory before exiting.
